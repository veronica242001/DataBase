#DataBase for Pharmaceutical Companies 

 Creating the database for the distribution of pharmaceuticals helped me be more analytical, more creative,
and apply my theoretical knowledge of SQL and PL/SQL.
 With the help of subprograms, collections (index-by tables, nested tables, varrays), cursors, packages, the
management of pharmaceuticals from the producer to the distributor and pharmacies was facilitated.
